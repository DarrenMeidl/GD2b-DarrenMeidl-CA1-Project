Pogo Mountain: The Demo is well.... a demo. Your goal? Reach the top of the Mountain or in this case, a small one. You've got Enemies to shoot & walls to shoot that you can teleport to! Navigate your way through some very simple easy puzzles (((because I am on a time crunch))) and attain personal glory by reaching the summit!

This game is heavily inspired by Teleportorium by Logan Lang!
